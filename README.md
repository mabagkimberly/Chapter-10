# Chapter-10

In this chapter, I learned how to build both simple and complex layouts in Flutter by combining and nesting widgets effectively. I discovered how to blend vertical and horizontal widgets to create custom designs, making layouts more flexible and visually appealing.

I explored essential UI-building widgets like SingleChildScrollView for handling overflow, SafeArea for ensuring content stays within device boundaries, and Padding for spacing elements properly. I also worked with Column and Row to arrange widgets, Image to display visuals, and Divider to separate sections cleanly.

Additionally, I learned how Text, Icon, SizedBox, Wrap, Chip, and CircleAvatar can enhance UI elements, adding structure and personality to the design. This chapter gave me the skills to craft dynamic, responsive layouts that improve the user experience.
